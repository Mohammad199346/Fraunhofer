# Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a virtual factory in Roblox. So far we have implemented a scenario where objects (like conveyor belts) of our virtual factory can be controlled from an external application. Below is the link to the virtual factory published to the Roblox:

### Technical Steps
-------------------
 Below are the steps we have performed for our first scenario:
1. Virtual Factory: We have created an experience (Factory) in Roblox. We have created our scene on Roblox Studio. In our scene we have created 4 main conveyors, 3 small conveyers, 6 packets and 3 containers. For our sceanario we are controlling conveyors from an external application. More information on how to get started with Roblox Studio can be found in the following link: https://create.roblox.com/docs/getting-started/introduction-to-roblox-studio
2. Backend API: We have created a backend api through which Roblox scene is being controlled.
